## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned:

This project was on easier side, and was used mainly to reinforce my Tailwind, and to practice it more.

### Continued development

For my next project I will focus on more complex React app with React Router, and it will be Country API challenge by Frontend Mentor.
