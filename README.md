## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React - JS library
- NProgress bar
- Vite

### What I learned

This project was on easier side, and was used mainly to reinforce my Tailwind, and to practice it more, and I can't forget NProgress bar is something new to me which I will use in future as well.

### Continued development

For my next project I will focus on more complex React app with React Router, and it will be Country API challenge by Frontend Mentor.
